                At various times over the past century and a half, the American
                nation has welcomed, expelled, tolerated, interned, ignored, and
                celebrated immigrants from Asia and their descendants. This course
                examines the fictions produced in response to these experiences.
                Irony, humor, history, tragedy and mystery all find a place in
                Asian American literature. We will see the emergence of a
                self-conscious Asian American identity, as well as more recent
                transnational structures of feeling. We will read novels and
                short stories by writers including Jhumpa Lahiri, Ha Jin,
                Le Thi Diem Thuy, Maxine Hong Kingston, Chang-rae Lee, and

                A close study of plays from the later half of Shakespeare’s career.
                 We’ll read six plays:  Measure for Measure, Othello, King Lear,
                 Pericles, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest.  The focus, first
                 and last, will be on the close, careful, and responsive reading
                 of these plays, working out together a sense of the meaningful
                 and memorable experiences that they offer us.  At the same time,
                 recognizing that these great plays were written originally as
                 scripts for performance, we will seek to learn about and to
                 re-imagine their life on the stage, exploring their historical
                 context, watching filmed versions of the plays, and attending at
                 least one live performance. Evaluations will include two essays,
                 a midterm, and a final exam, and students will have the opportunity
                 to undertake creative and performance projects.

                This Calderwood seminar in public writing will show that there is
                no such thing as dead poetry. In a series of weekly writing and
                editing exercises ranging from movie reviews to op-eds, we will
                explore the many ways that the great poetry of centuries past
                speaks directly to modern experience. We will be taught both by
                the poets themselves (whose eloquence will rub off on us) and
                each other, as each student will pick a poet whose writing she
                will become expert at relaying to a lay audience. By the end of
                the semester, not only will you be able to persuade a newspaper
                reader that blank verse matters as much as Twitter; you will also
                learn how to articulate the value of your English major to a
                prospective employer--and how to transmit your excitement about
                the latest discoveries in your field to friends and parents.

                The poems and letters of Emily Dickinson, arguably the most
                important American poet of the nineteenth century, provide a
                window into one of the most thrilling and idiosyncratic minds in
                literature. Dickinson lived her entire adult life in her family's
                elegant home on the main street of Amherst, Massachusetts, writing
                in her spacious bedroom through the night. The house and its views,
                as well as its gardens and paths, are all vivid presences in her
                work. Dickinson hand-wrote all of her poems on paper she scavenged
                around the house; scholars are still debating how to read and
                interpret her hand-done poems. To study Dickinson is to be
                confronted with questions that seem sometimes more forensic than
                literary critical. We will explore Dickinson's online archives
                and visit, several times, her house and gardens in Amherst. This
                course should appeal not only to lovers of poetry but to lovers of
                old houses, scrapbooks, ghost stories, and the material history of
                the New England region.

                This course surveys literary artifacts from the Middle Ages,
                focusing primarily on case studies that exemplify how medieval
                men and women constructed, endorsed, or revolutionized their
                perception of the world. We will explore key genres such as epic
                poetry, history writing, religious texts, travelogues, lyric,
                romance, narrative fiction, and theater. For each genre, we will
                discuss texts written or translated in medieval England side by
                side with counterparts originating in Africa, and Asia, and Europe.
                Topics include the Song of Roland, John Mandeville’s Travels,
                Barlaam and Iosaphat, the Letter of Prester John, and The Thousand
                and One Nights.

                The period known as the Enlightenment (roughly 1660-1789) promoted
                individual rights, attacked superstition and advanced science,
                dramatically expanded literacy and publishing, brought women as
                readers and writers into a burgeoning literary marketplace, and
                created the public sphere. Yet the era also massively increased
                the trans-Atlantic slave trade, devised new forms of racism and
                anti-feminism, and established European colonialism as a world
                system. This course will examine British literature that confronts
                these complexities. We’ll read novels like Behn’s Oroonoko, Defoe’s
                Robinson Crusoe, and Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels that portray
                encounters between Europeans and the non-European “Other”; poems
                by Alexander Pope and Mary Wortley Montagu that explore the nature
                of women and femininity; and texts that find the limits of
                Enlightenment reason in uncertainty, strong passions, and madness.
