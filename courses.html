            This course offers an introduction to contemporary African politics.
            The primary goal is to introduce students to the diversity of challenges
            and development issues facing African countries since independence.
            Questions motivating the course include: (1) Why state institutions
            weaker in African than in other developing regions? (2) What explains
            Africa's slow economic growth? (3) What can be done to improve political
            accountability on the continent? (4) Why have some African countries
            been plagued by high levels of political violence while others have not?
            In answering these questions, we will examine Africa’s historical
            experiences, its economic heritage, and the international context in
            which it is embedded.  At the same time, we will explore how Africans
            have responded to unique circumstances to shape their own political and
            economic situations. As we address the core themes of the course, we
            will draw on a wide range of academic disciplines, including political
            science, history, economics and anthropology. We will study particular
            events in particular African countries, but we will also examine broad
            patterns across countries and use social science concepts and methods
            to try to explain them.

            This course explores the historical landscape of Ancient Africa,
            with specific emphasis on its founding civilizations, politics,
            trade & commerce, culture and cosmologies. It serves to dispel the
            myth that the African continent was ahistorical, “dark” and primitive
            before European invasion in the 1400s. Through an interdisciplinary
            approach, the course encourages students to critically engage Africa
            from an Afro-centric perspective by examining its ancient kingdoms
            such as Egypt, Ghana, Mali, Songhay and Great Zimbabwe. It is
            anticipated that by studying these early civilizations and cultural
            formations, students will see Africa’s contribution and engagement
            in the global exchange of ideas and goods. Major themes include the
            political, economic and social impacts of European imperialism; the
            Atlantic Slave Trade; ‘Legitimate Trade’ and prelude to colonialism.

             dimensions, and 2) the cultural expression, particularly music and art.
             Special emphasis will be placed on gospel music, Womanist and Black
             Liberation theologies as forms of political action and responses to
             interpretations of race in the context of American religious pluralism.

            This Calderwood seminar in public writing will show that there is
            no such thing as dead poetry. In a series of weekly writing and
            editing exercises ranging from movie reviews to op-eds, we will
            explore the many ways that the great poetry of centuries past
            speaks directly to modern experience. We will be taught both by
            the poets themselves (whose eloquence will rub off on us) and
            each other, as each student will pick a poet whose writing she
            will become expert at relaying to a lay audience. By the end of
            the semester, not only will you be able to persuade a newspaper
            reader that blank verse matters as much as Twitter; you will also
            learn how to articulate the value of your English major to a
            prospective employer--and how to transmit your excitement about
            the latest discoveries in your field to friends and parents.

            The poems and letters of Emily Dickinson, arguably the most
            important American poet of the nineteenth century, provide a
            window into one of the most thrilling and idiosyncratic minds in
            literature. Dickinson lived her entire adult life in her family's
            elegant home on the main street of Amherst, Massachusetts, writing
            in her spacious bedroom through the night. The house and its views,
            as well as its gardens and paths, are all vivid presences in her
            work. Dickinson hand-wrote all of her poems on paper she scavenged
            around the house; scholars are still debating how to read and
            interpret her hand-done poems. To study Dickinson is to be
            confronted with questions that seem sometimes more forensic than
            literary critical. We will explore Dickinson's online archives
            and visit, several times, her house and gardens in Amherst. This
            course should appeal not only to lovers of poetry but to lovers of
            old houses, scrapbooks, ghost stories, and the material history of
            the New England region.

            This course surveys literary artifacts from the Middle Ages,
            focusing primarily on case studies that exemplify how medieval
            men and women constructed, endorsed, or revolutionized their
            perception of the world. We will explore key genres such as epic
            poetry, history writing, religious texts, travelogues, lyric,
            romance, narrative fiction, and theater. For each genre, we will
            discuss texts written or translated in medieval England side by
            side with counterparts originating in Africa, and Asia, and Europe.
            Topics include the Song of Roland, John Mandeville’s Travels,
            Barlaam and Iosaphat, the Letter of Prester John, and The Thousand
            and One Nights.

            The period known as the Enlightenment (roughly 1660-1789) promoted
            individual rights, attacked superstition and advanced science,
            dramatically expanded literacy and publishing, brought women as
            readers and writers into a burgeoning literary marketplace, and
            created the public sphere. Yet the era also massively increased
            the trans-Atlantic slave trade, devised new forms of racism and
            anti-feminism, and established European colonialism as a world
            system. This course will examine British literature that confronts
            these complexities. We’ll read novels like Behn’s Oroonoko, Defoe’s
            Robinson Crusoe, and Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels that portray
            encounters between Europeans and the non-European “Other”; poems
            by Alexander Pope and Mary Wortley Montagu that explore the nature
            of women and femininity; and texts that find the limits of
            Enlightenment reason in uncertainty, strong passions, and madness.
